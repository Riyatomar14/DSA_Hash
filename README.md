# DSA_Hash
###### It is a data structure which is mostly used in dev . time complexitity of deletion,insertion,searching etc have very low i.e in constant time o(1).
###### The hash map is used whenever data is stored as key-value pairs, where values can be added, retrieved, and deleted using keys. In the example below, a HashMap object has been created to search for cities by their postal codes, after which four postal code-city pairs have been added to the HashMap object.

implementation: 
### by linked list o(n)
### by BST o(logn)
### but by the use of HASHMAP o(1).

## INBUILT STUFF
1. map --> o(logn)
2. unordered-map --> o(1)
